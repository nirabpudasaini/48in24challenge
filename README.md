# 48in24challenge
Doing the 48in24 challange from exercism by solving 48 programming exercises in 2024. Check out the challange at [exercism](https://exercism.org/challenges/48in24). 

I am planning to do the challange first in Go and then in Kotlin and Typescript. Excersim has different language recommendation for different challenge so check it out. I will be doing the excersise in exercism as well but I have a seperate repo so that I can also learn to write test cases.
